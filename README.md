# üîß PHP Task Manager

This is a clean and simple PHP-based task manager I built to practice CRUD operations, user authentication, and backend logic. It uses PHP and MySQL, and I‚Äôve structured it to be secure, organized, and easy to follow. Screenshots are included for documentation and certification evidence.
